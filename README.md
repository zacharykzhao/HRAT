## Installation

Before getting started, we recommend setting up a Python 3(>=3.6.12) virtual environment. For APPMod (Android Application Manipulation Tool in our paper,), ensure you have installed a Java SDK >= 1.8.0_282.





Because our APK parsing process (extracting function call graphs, node lists and node constraints) and APK manipulation process are based on Java and function call modification process is based on 



+ Step 1: Extract function graph, node lists and node constraints from APK files:

  + ```python
    python3 PreprocessAPK.py --apk_path apk_file_path -- output_path save_folder_path
    ```

  + before that please include 'android_jars' under current folder: 

  + please download the *PreprocessAPK.jar* from: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CGEF_i5ss_pQ4uBq_jYr9MhxUIRGdHJz?usp=sharing  , and put it under *./libs*

  + The Java source code of APK preprocess can be found under: */APPMod/PreprocessAPK*
